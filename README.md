## About

This project is for learning how to work with wxWidgets and database, it takes inspiration from Far Cry 4's KEO company with some liberties to give it some theme and test data.

   cd ConsoleArt
   make
   ```

## Project guide

- .hpp is used for single file code, that don't have coresponfing .cpp file

## Donate

I'm a ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¿ student, so a few dollars will be enough. If you are planning to use this library in a commercial application, then it would be fair if you would send more, possibly a small share of 5-10% of monthly profits.
